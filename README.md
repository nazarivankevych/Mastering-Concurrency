# Mastering Concurrency in Python

**Create faster programs using concurrency, asynchronous, multithreading, and parallel programming**


## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
async def main(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        await download_html(session, url)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you're a developer familiar who's and you Python who want to learn to build high-performance applications that scale by leveraging single-core, multi-core, or distributed concurrency, then this book is for you.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-19).
